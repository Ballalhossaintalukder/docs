## About Registering GitHub Apps

You can register a GitHub App in various ways:

- **Personal Account:** Register the app under your personal GitHub account.
- **Organization:** Register the app under an organization you own or manage.
- **Enterprise:** Register the app under your enterprise account, but it can only be installed on organizations within the enterprise.

> **Note:** You can register up to 100 GitHub Apps per account.

## Steps to Register a GitHub App

1. Navigate to the GitHub Apps settings.
2. Click **New GitHub App**.
3. Enter a **Name** for your app. The name must be unique across GitHub and cannot exceed 34 characters.
4. (Optional) Enter a **Description** for your app. This description will be visible to users and organizations when they install your app.
5. Enter the **Homepage URL** for your app. If you don't have a dedicated URL, you can use the URL of your public repository.
6. (Optional) Enter up to 10 **Callback URLs**. These URLs will be used to redirect users after they authorize the installation. For more details, see [About the User Authorization Callback URL](/apps/creating-github-apps/setting-up-a-github-app/about-the-user-authorization-callback-url).
7. (Optional) Configure user authorization and device flow settings.
8. (Optional) Enter a **Setup URL** to guide users through additional setup steps after installation.
9. Configure **Webhook** settings and permissions as needed.
10. Select where the GitHub App can be installed: **Only on this account** or **Any account**.
